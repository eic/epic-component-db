# The Component DB

This repository currently serves to describe our findings about, and experimentation with,
the "Component DB" currently deployed for testing purposes by the BNL CAD. It was originally
developed at ANL. We are conducting a feasibility study to determine whether it would meet
the needs of the EIC project and the ePIC Collaboration.
